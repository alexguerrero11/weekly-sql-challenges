/* Exercise 01 - Produce a list of costly bookings
How can you produce a list of bookings on the day of 2012-09-14 which will cost the member (or guest) more than $30? Remember that guests have different costs to members (the listed costs are per half-hour 'slot'), and the guest user is always ID 0.

Order by descending cost, and do not use any subqueries. */
